# bubbles_v2
This is the finished version to the original bubbles repo.

This version adds random colors to the circles and on a mouse event, the circles grow and shrink as the mouse moves across the canvas. The canvas is responsive and the circles will populate as the canvas shrinks and grows. The circles are at various sizes and move at various speeds around the canvas.
